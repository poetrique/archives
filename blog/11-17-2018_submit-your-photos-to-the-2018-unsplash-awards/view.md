### [Submit Your Photos To The 2018 **Unsplash Awards**](./view.md)

The Unsplash Awards is a month-long celebration created to recognize the powerful impact Unsplash contributors have made through their generosity and artistry. Every day, thousands of photographers freely gift their work on Unsplash to move creativity forward.

#### [**12 Categories**](#)

We’ve created 12 photography categories to feature the work of Unsplash contributors throughout November and December. For each category, we’ve invited a guest judge to help select the featured photos.

[1. Diversity](#)

Photography that captures the underrepresented in stock photography such as different body types, disability awareness, ethnicity, feminism and the LGBTQ+ community.
