## Understand

we are odd  
as a glitch rainbow  
that's why, queens  
dream, when we say so  

we are digital Freuds  
our mentality  
is hot as fuego  
our spirituality is firm  
you must know  

we are the children  
of tomorrow

## Pretty

I need me a poet  
a pretty rose  
black, with a heart  
and skin of gold  

to walk with me as  
I will conquer oblivion  
someone, bold  
wise enough to love truly

## Vulnerable

I will open up  
being successful and alone  
is painful, stressful  
you can not know  
how it hurts  
... to the bone  

I need no pity  
I need no love  
all I want is warmth  
a heart to nurse my mind  
and comfort

## I Said

I am not a player  
I am a lover  
who happens to like games  

no two hearts are the same  
you sing out my name  
when we dance the dance  
of the moon and the stars  

I only want warm love  
you said, I said

## King Talk

move like you speak  
man is a lion  
not a mouse  
so man will no longer squeak

for my destiny is more ablaze  
than the tip of the sun  
in the sky

## Night

to each his own  
to birds, flight  
to gods, night  
to men, fright  

when you the sun falls  
I rise up, I take off  
I take what's mine  
I hustle & break hearts

#### Highways

heading to the city  
coming from the jungle  
I will be a King  
do you not hear  
my words rumble  

the road is not the journey  
the path is not the way  
I know this, and can say  
much more  
but not today

#### Non

yes, indeed  
I know what I need  
not belief alone  
I have planted the seed  

yes, indeed  
I know why I bleed  
not for joy alone  
but for the war ahead

#### Her Words

his mind is sweet  
it tastes like  
wine and poetry  
fire and history  

his soul is something  
else entirely  
wild, yet sweet still  
it could build or kill

## Hard to stay sane

So much in my head  
it's hard to stay sane...  
The next person might have it  
worse so I try not to complain...  

In a world where even she  
who smiles can't tell if her  
smile is real or fake...  

Still I find pleasure  
in life's endless possibilities,  
in the bittersweet naughtiness,  
and in everything that makes me Ray…

## terminal maestro

I am a different kind of person  
I think in color, and breathe in static  
My people are **electric**  

We come from the planet  
... after Pluto, and  
love machines beautiful  
We have _souls_ prone to changes  
When we push and pull our hearts  

We are of the race, digital && bohemian  
I am a coder, my lovers are alien  

CTRL+C : that is all

## Beauty in  the war

I was told not to trust a soul...  
Made to understand that  
this place is not my home..  
Indeed so many, so many  
things I've been sold..  

But your love, your love baby  
the only thing that keeps me whole.

## I am YOU with a different name

When I look at a child, my baby I see...  

Thoughts of my parents come alive  
when I'm in a space with the elderly...  

But whenever I see a young man or woman,  
I see myself with a different name and face.  
I see the image of  
a boy or girl that could have been me…

## Double You

"We" wouldn't be an item  
if not for the letter "W"...  
It kinda reminds me of a part of you  
I can't wait to suckle soon.  
W and double u are pronounced alike  
so maybe I should double you.  

Obviously am playing with words here but  
All I'm tryna say is last night when you asked me  
if I wanted a threesome? my heart whispered yes baby!  
Double You.

## the citadel

#### premium

a taste of greatness

we **make love**  
sweet, _sublime_

## confession

i cannot promise you joy     
for i yet still learn it     
the road to strength, to truth     
is full of labour and wrath     

if you still choose to love     
**by all means** continue along     
just beware, i am more used to     
the anxiety of vigour     
than being under love's stupour     

i will teach you, heal you, give you     
drops of warmth and wisdom     
from the sun and way beyond     
that is all i can offer, in place of love

## Scaredy-cat

Brightness of the day fades away.     
The rise of a gloomy night.     
Owls echoing within the walls.     
Boom!!! That sound of thunder,     
Took the whole of my fears further.     

Illusion; what it first seems like.     
Slowly, a U-turn into pure reality.     
One by one, step by step,     
it breaks the soul to pieces.     
A candy that became suddenly sour.     

**_“Face your own fears”_**     
The quote that every tongue quotes,     
Like it is as easy as ABC.     
But when the demons rise up,     
Running seems to be the best option.     

Scary, scary, scary     
Dark nights are scary,     
Damn!!! Nights are scary.     
And I am weary.     
I am a scaredy-cat.

weakness is not a choice

i must withdraw     
and only wisely pursue sensation     
for i am too inclined

this is a thing,     
that springs from the virility     
of youth, of man     
of passions held down     

i must look at my soul     
and force it to look at me

## no more white lies

#### nymph

what or who, do you worship     
are you brave enough     
to love the broken, and rough     
**_bad gyal_**  you claim to be     
you wild lies have no teeth     

come at me, test a poet warrior     
twist and combine your thighs with mine     
let us erupt an artistic volcano     
my mind is a rabid ocean     
you will not survive in your canoe

#### a million

can honesty fit     
in a tight, five-lined haiku     
thoughts roar in me

#### crown

she said, she was not a queen     
she claimed she was too dirty-minded     
to be that within     
she did not believe my lies     

i am no saint     
a crown does not mean honesty     
i told her honestly     
everything i did see     
that her vanity was far deeper     
than the oceans, than any sea

## strength

i feel the weakness     
of my wrong decisions     
it will be dealt with     
without resolutions     

i will redeem my fire     
the strength that i desire     
it will come to me     
as surely as blessings     
from clouds on high

## enter my universe

#### venus

i do not want a girlfriend     
_that's childish_     
i want a **lover**     
_that's grown sh!t_     

i want my moon     
to tickle a star     
i want a sun     
to wrap around     
my cold heart     
and kiss me with warmth

love is for **the brave**

#### uranus

we dance close to the sun      
nearer to the moon though      
for **love is** lunacy      
and a heavenly **fantasy**      

but i can promise nothing      
i am darker than eternity      
the joy of life, the pain of love      
sound alike to me

## moist

to speak to my readers     
the _young_ and **bold**     
of desire, would be     
to preach to the choir     

we seek in the hearts     
of our lovers, nothing but warmth     
in the lips of our heart-throbs     
a liquor pure and hot     
between the thighs     
of our flings, something nice

## Open places

#### 1. Wasted

My dignity given to a damn fool     
Just like common water, thrown away     
without value     
All for the pleasure of fame...

#### 2. Him

He read my words and understood me     
The words I didn't understand he understood     
And drawing meaning out of it,     
Gave me something I had forgotten.

## july 5th 2018

every time thunder     
kisses the night sky     
the stars shift with grace     
i hear the heavens sigh     

two perfect lovers     
one inconsistent, shy     
one dark and sure     
their love, both bold and pure

## pipe no longer smokes

the moniker holds no meaning     
games are for the weak     
a name is nothing to play with     
i bear mine, and lose no sleep

## untitled

I think of ways to  give up for good     
But remember that my life isn't mine     
Waiting for suicide to come as death     

I really want to cut myself     
But I can't,  because I  made a promise     
I'm sad angry and hurt     
I'm tired of life     
I want to cry but I  can't     
I'm so sorry for ranting to you

I wanted a father

## Uncertain

I fell in love with you to lift my burden      
Because I couldn't carry it alone      
I wasn't strong enough to       

I thought you knew it       
Now I wake up an empty vessel       
Incomplete       

Uncertain of how to continue...

## Bravado

don't need your platform to perform      
a chance to prove myself      
am improving I just need to money-proof myself      
still selfish with beef     
many were called I choose myself      
make e'm see reasons never to re-introduce themselves     
just praise ma absence     
crave ma presence      
i propose your purpose is to be obsessed      
with the power I possess      
so you can expose secrets n dispose      
your fears then do away with whatever      
comes close when you suppose      
bring down to nothing everything      
they think they have upstairs     
then leave e'm upset     
lights cameras action     
Am I yet on set?     
nah fuck fame     
am a project in progress n     
winter is coming     
brace yourself     
create some space to separate spite from hate,      
light from weight,then embrace      
yourself hoping someone relates     
forsake the fake to die for a sake      
n wake when everybody think its late

#### gravitated

> **_i am great_**     

i whisper in my mind     
all alone in the universe     
but i am just a teen     

> **_i am great_**     

i want to believe     
as i write this     
i am alone on a field     

> **_i am great_**     

but my worth is in the stars     
and i am on earth     
on dust and stone, far from home

> **_i am great_**     

but who cares in truth     
o breathe in smoke     
to ease the pain     

> **_i am great_**     

but talk too much     
but feel too much     
will this gravitated pain, ever stop

#### rooftop

next and first     
time i make love     
it will be beneath the sky     
on an elevated level     
the simple will call a roof     

i will be high     
on a love potion     
of wine and lean     
i will forever afterwards     
become of poetry, a god

#### calmer than stone

my special yellow pill     
makes me hungry     
and inclined to sleep     
makes me inclined to weep     

if i were a bird     
i would never fly.     
even with wings     
larger than the sky     
i would be too shy to fly     

no one understands me     
so i will withdraw     
not into a shell, that is but hell     

solid i shall be     
i know nothing yet     

of the true me

close friend of the muse      
i am still inclined to adore     

even when she     
leaves me in my agony for him     
i can trust     
she believes i can be more      

> called me boring      

when i think in every colour      
of the most twisted monochromatic rainbow     

i do not try to repent      
of the anguish that i repress     
for even gods weep      
and some still have much fear

## wait for my hair to grow

then you will know      
the manner of       
**this** ancient bloody flow      
**this** beauty that is my pain     

_that_ boy you thought was nothing      
_that_ genius you left, with no loving      
you will learn that i am golden     
broken, wavy and holy

## bread and water

that feeling of being artistic          
that borders on madness,            
far from realistic          

that makes the simple           
to feel they are kingly         
that waters pure folly          
and ruins humanity          

**_it now haunts me_**          
**_shall i fall or stand_**         

that feeling of being artistic          
that helps the weak         
feel strong, and more than heroic           

that makes the broken           
rise and scream prophecy            
that trims off all evil         
from the soul of man            

**_it now haunts me_**

#### Just right

I’m not even sure how all this ties up,       
To make sense but it feels right,       
With knees to the ground and eyes up,       
It just feels right.        

With every mistake made and repeated,       
Lessons not learnt and mind undefeated,       
Repentance, repentance, secreted,       
It all feels just right.        

Encounter upon departure,       
Departure upon merger,        
Tightly-knit circles,       
Now this, this feels quite right.       

Loyalty to betrayal,        
There’s never a round for trials,       
Only those that are tribulations,       
The test run is the actual situation,       
Calculate your risks,       
Even if you don’t,        
At some point,      
You can get used to anything,       
It will all feel just right.

#### How to cook pride

Chop it into pieces,      
Stir it up in a bowl,       
Boil it,        
Sprinkle a spice here, a tear there,            
Marinade it in justification and excuses,       
Preheat your Dutch oven         
that is you ever-so-accurate mind,      
With a side of your largest ego,        
You can butter the pan with the         
lies that you tell yourself,        

Fry it if you want,         
Deep-fry it in the depth        
of all the disappointment,      
As the snaps of their heart         
breaks echo from the fire,      

After you have done all this,       
Or whichever you please,        
You may swallow it.     
And wash it down with a tall glass       
of that ice-cold heart.

#### Power to will

Discipline,         
Is the power of willpower,          
The power to will your mind into        
selectively choosing what is right for you,     
Even when what is right for you         
is not what is easy for you,        
Even when what is right for you         
might not be what is good for you,      
At the time,        
Even when what is right for you      
might just be what brings you pain,     
Even when what is right for         
might not actually be right for you but right for,      
Him, for her, for them.     

The power to will your mind         
into choosing tomorrow over today,      
To look up from your screen         
so you can see the bigger picture.

#### Get to know you        

The most fun I have ever had            
 is getting to know me,         
For me,         
Through me,         
Through God.            

My likes, my dislikes,          
My path …           
Without the pressure and noise          
from the buzzing of notifications,          
Without justifying me           
and actually being true to me.          

Without feeling the need            
to be complemented by anything or anyone,           
Rushed by anything,         
Compared, measured,         
Genuinely living for me,            
It is like an extra Sunday to the week,         
Like the extra five minutes in the morning,         
Like always being on top of your own peak,          
And like the nightingale, I will sing,              
The song of my rejoice that need not be sung,           
For it is its own anthem.

you who judge me      

i do so too

what's a crow, what's a dove

wrap itself around a soul, if you know          	
tell me if you know         	

all we can ever do,         
is ride low         	
there is no black         
son of god, no dark apostle         	

but i hold it not against any religion

creatures of the darkness,        
* they feed on the darkness,        

that lurks in our soul        
* pressuring our misery         
  to build their bones        
* destroying our walls,         
  and stealing the stones       

so we're lost in the ruins,         
of our newly corrupted soul.

#### one day

Maybe one day life        
won't be so complicated,        
Maybe one day we'll shed        
all the insecurities        

that have grown on us and have         
souls that are pure and naked,        
Maybe one day our innocence we'll regain,       
When that time comes we will be children again        

We'll be free to cast our worries aside,        
Forget our problems and throw away        
all the sorrows we have to hide,        
Maybe one day we'll be free to soar         
through life like birds in the sky,       

And maybe one day         
pigs will grow wings        
and learn how to fly

#### prince turned king

I remain hidden in fluctuating        
shades of grey and black        

Horrified by the slaughter of my people       
Horrified by the slaughter of my kind       

I remain hidden for fear of my demise         
And with pain I watch as my father is also        
Slain       

The crown falls from atop his head        
immediately I'm sure he is dead         
Cause the African holds on to the crown till death        

Still in motion the crown         
finds my hiding place and         
stops it's movement at my feet        

I was a prince but now I am king

## fool no more

i am a fool no more         
life is cool no more        
i stare at reality        
angry and calm        

i count my sins       
they climb up to the stars.       
nothing soothes       
no one can choose       
the darkness of their soul        

momma wants me to be holy       
poppa just wants me to be         
yet he is never around me       

there is no one to ease       
i seek no longer to please

## pointless

do not fight        
the demons that you see       
the pain within your soul       
your sorrows turned to joy      
the world is just too cold        

do not fight        
the love you know to doubt        
whisper and then shout        
the gods are too asleep       
to help you out         

do not fight        
who you know you are        
you could be a star       
or a blackhole        
either way, you are in the sky        

do not fight        
what helps you remember       
you are made of gold        
who cares if no one cares        
wipe away your tears        

do not fight        
the colours on your soul        
the red that proves you are bloody        
the black that is your mind       
the green that is your flag       

do not fight        
the pointlessness of life       
there is no rhythm to reality       
no one will sing your song        
till you claim it is your anthem

## SILLY THOUGHTS

Sometimes I feel invisible or like      
I exist only in someone's subconscious.       

Like, what if I'm not real        
I mean, what if I'm just a part         
of someone's reality.       
Or what if this is just         
someone's nightmare, Because        
I'm definitely not living a dream.        

I mean, I know for sure         
there could be infinite alternate realities        
to every reality.       

My reality isn't convincing enough.

when i tried to look back     
leave me in my misery      

i am not dark     
_just the opposite of white_

## wolf abuse

puppy dog love     
turns to wolf abuse     

come not to me     
when he does refuse     

**nothing is ever worth, feeling anything**     

perhaps i was too cocky     
and the lord thus decided     
to shock me     

**nothing is ever worth, feeling anything**

## nostalgia

i miss the former days     
when life passed in a daze     

and i knew never time

just after i fell

falselly accused     

from grace

#### my reality

it takes an insect     
in my eye to make me _weep_      

and a prescribed pill
to make me **sleep**

i gamble with machinations     
foster calculations     
just so, i do not feel like **_sheep_**

#### queen

i knew her for half a second    
that was enough     
she is the last    
in a recent rapid succession

to ignore my love     
and my soul rebuff

she had a     
rapid fire spirit     
bright as the sun, was she ...     
she was my new religion     
i stood at her pulpit     

**_now i know_**     
**_i can never serve_**     
**_the god king of love_**

i made my lips sweet     
for a _convo_ that never held

an unwilling third     

i still cannot share my love

## the show

we are on the waves    
surfing, but never drowning    
screaming but never shouting    
speaking from our souls   

we keep it simple    
open and unspoken    
moving agendas,    
shinying shields, and blades   
mental precision   

**_the show is more than the mic spit_**   
**_we pilot the art - this is the cockpit_**   

on the steady   
clearly ready   
nothing bloddy   
dirty logic   

we are the new scientists   
ancient like kings   
postmodern relics   

we are the new preachers   
teaching the soft religion   
moving like ghosts   
walking like wolves   
we are the new magicians   

**_the show is more than the mic spit_**   
**_we pilot the art - this is the cockpit_**   

we know all our brothers   
we rock all the borders   
we are up in the air   
like bluebirds    

of all the cool faces   
we make up two-thirds   
we are aiming for greatness    
we do what we want to     
there is nothing holding us back

#### a man

first and foremost   
thus, i need a companion   

no one can truly breathe alone   

teach me to roam    
across the brightest part   
of Hades' sky    

so i can be the one for you   

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

#### love galore

i can be loyal     
i need someone   
to be so for   

leave me when you feel    
nothing again   
do not just drift   
like golden dust, again   
let me know - **then**

sigh atop me   
keep it simple   
blunt and free

## what i have to say

#### for now

the pain is a game   
a two minute race   
without face   
without pace   

its a mental mirage   
that burns from within   
it soothes too, i must confess   

herein lies the truth   
of my pathetic sin

#### barsman

i burn bars   
not for ectasy   

but to reclaim

my weak hold on vanity

#### better already

do i swim or wade through life   
seek out bitter, endless strife

#### my mind beats

illogical  
balanced and grotesque  

like a jungle  
voltaire  
i think _candide_  

instead  
of my heart  
i need it to feel

#### ... i need a muse

offers were up  
down to the ground  

no one can hear  
my soul's very sound  

i tire of speaking  
painting, and explaining  

the pits of my being  
and broken lofty peaks
