### [heart song](#)

silence is the sound of power  
i must contain my  
youthful misery  

so what, if i have never known love  
so what, if i am seen as strange  
why care when i can change the world  
and write each day, a brand new page

i must listen to my heart sing  
oh how faint its sound now is  

i must build echo  
like ashes grown to tall wild flame

### [my new resolve](#)

i will hold my heart  
in my left hand  
far away from love

i have feared to be  
i care not if i can  
or should, in verity

### [Me, Moi - Oui](#)

i am one of three  
love, trust, and belief  
are all you need to see  
my tri-reality  

i have fallen, 
time and again   
i am whipped  
by my own hand  
it firmly grips  
an ancient chain

but no more.  
Look, you will see  
... that is all

### [New Year, Wake Up!](#)

Some people will never know victory  
because they already see themselves  
as victims of circumstances.  

Met an old friend looking unusual,  
oboi weytin happen to you  
then he was like "life happened"  
drowning in self pity.  

But it's a matter of choice  
I chose to close my eyes  
to those that chase no goals.  

They don't call shots rather  
the ones that get shot at,  
I call them the shadow chasing ghost,  
in a play without roles,  
there anything goes.  

Do you really want  
to make it in life  
or make excuses for not making it?  

For yourself you should be able  
to fistfight in the cold without gloves,  
because life doesn't warn you before she hits you.  

Call it the school of hard knocks,  
knowledge for self reliance,  
result I wish you good luck.  

If education is the only key   
Then ignorance is a badluck  
What good is a key to you  
staring at a stumbling block?  

I think life is the Door  
and Education is just a polite knock  
to opportunities. 

breakthrough or get stuck in the same spot

### [vino & 'bacco](#)

my way is mine  
i paid my time  
greatness for me  
for you, for us, for we  
i do not lie  
... really

i caress my demons  
they are more than tame  
now, they bow  
i like the red, and the brown  
maybe cause  
i am a child of the earth  
and i bleed up,  
never down

art is war  
do you not believe

### give & take

I seek not fame  
but to make a name  
love and pain  
they both taste the same  

you sang of want  
need and desire  
made me parched  
with your ancient fire  

I hunted fate  
you hunted a mate  
we both did get  
each, what we required

### [baby](#)

I am an old mind  
you are a young star  
you think in rosy

you could never love me  
for I detest reality  
does that make me a baby?  
my simple love for vanity

### [one-eyed](#)

you were the moon  
and I, the sun  
one-eyed, broken  
and full of fear  

you took my mind  
and gently kissed  
away all pain,  
every ugly care

and for that  
I praise you  
where the gods seat

in the sky,  
the kingdom of air

## Understand

we are odd  
as a glitch rainbow  
that's why, queens  
dream, when we say so  

we are digital Freuds  
our mentality  
is hot as fuego  
our spirituality is firm  
you must know  

we are the children  
of tomorrow

#### Highways

heading to the city  
coming from the jungle  
I will be a King  
do you not hear  
my words rumble  

the road is not the journey  
the path is not the way

much more  
but not today

## Hard to stay sane

So much in my head  
it's hard to stay sane...  
The next person might have it  
worse so I try not to complain...  

In a world where even she  
who smiles can't tell if her  
smile is real or fake...  

Still I find pleasure  
in life's endless possibilities,  
in the bittersweet naughtiness,  
and in everything that makes me Ray…

## terminal maestro

I am a different kind of person  
I think in color, and breathe in static  
My people are **electric**  

We come from the planet  
... after Pluto, and  
love machines beautiful  
We have _souls_ prone to changes  
When we push and pull our hearts  

We are of the race, digital && bohemian  
I am a coder, my lovers are alien

## Beauty in  the war

I was told not to trust a soul...  
Made to understand that  
this place is not my home..  
Indeed so many, so many  
things I've been sold..  

But your love, your love baby  
the only thing that keeps me whole.

## I am YOU with a different name

When I look at a child, my baby I see...  

Thoughts of my parents come alive  
when I'm in a space with the elderly...  

But whenever I see a young man or woman,  
I see myself with a different name and face.  
I see the image of  
a boy or girl that could have been me…

## Double You

"We" wouldn't be an item  
if not for the letter "W"...  
It kinda reminds me of a part of you  
I can't wait to suckle soon.  
W and double u are pronounced alike  
so maybe I should double you.  

Obviously am playing with words here but  
All I'm tryna say is last night when you asked me  
if I wanted a threesome? my heart whispered yes baby!  
Double You.

we **make love**

## confession

i cannot promise you joy     
for i yet still learn it     
the road to strength, to truth     
is full of labour and wrath     

if you still choose to love     
**by all means** continue along     
just beware, i am more used to     
the anxiety of vigour     
than being under love's stupour     

i will teach you, heal you, give you     
drops of warmth and wisdom     
from the sun and way beyond     
that is all i can offer, in place of love

## Scaredy-cat

Brightness of the day fades away.     
The rise of a gloomy night.     
Owls echoing within the walls.     
Boom!!! That sound of thunder,     
Took the whole of my fears further.     

Illusion; what it first seems like.     
Slowly, a U-turn into pure reality.     
One by one, step by step,     
it breaks the soul to pieces.     
A candy that became suddenly sour.     

**_“Face your own fears”_**     
The quote that every tongue quotes,     
Like it is as easy as ABC.     
But when the demons rise up,     
Running seems to be the best option.     

Scary, scary, scary     
Dark nights are scary,     
Damn!!! Nights are scary.     
And I am weary.     
I am a scaredy-cat.

As I lay down to sleep

weakness is not a choice     
not an option anymore     
you cannot climb great mountains     
just at the peak, to fall

they all did watch their demons roar     
then beat them to the floor

and only wisely pursue sensation     
for i am too inclined

this is a thing,     
that springs from the virility     
of youth, of man     
of passions held down     

i must look at my soul     
and force it to look at me

of philosophy and bliss     

a warm soul     
like no other

## Uncertain

I fell in love with you to lift my burden      
Because I couldn't carry it alone      
I wasn't strong enough to       

I thought you knew it       
Now I wake up an empty vessel       
Incomplete       

Uncertain of how to continue...

## Bravado

don't need your platform to perform      
a chance to prove myself      
am improving I just need to money-proof myself      
still selfish with beef     
many were called I choose myself      
make e'm see reasons never to re-introduce themselves     
just praise ma absence     
crave ma presence      
i propose your purpose is to be obsessed      
with the power I possess      
so you can expose secrets n dispose      
your fears then do away with whatever      
comes close when you suppose      
bring down to nothing everything      
they think they have upstairs     
then leave e'm upset     
lights cameras action     
Am I yet on set?     
nah fuck fame     
am a project in progress n     
winter is coming     
brace yourself     
create some space to separate spite from hate,      
light from weight,then embrace      
yourself hoping someone relates     
forsake the fake to die for a sake      
n wake when everybody think its late

## when i was low

#### gravitated

> **_i am great_**     

i whisper in my mind     
all alone in the universe     
but i am just a teen     

> **_i am great_**     

i want to believe     
as i write this     
i am alone on a field     

> **_i am great_**     

but my worth is in the stars     
and i am on earth     
on dust and stone, far from home

> **_i am great_**     

but who cares in truth     
o breathe in smoke     
to ease the pain     

> **_i am great_**     

but talk too much     
but feel too much     
will this gravitated pain, ever stop

#### rooftop

next and first     
time i make love     
it will be beneath the sky     
on an elevated level     
the simple will call a roof     

i will be high     
on a love potion     
of wine and lean     
i will forever afterwards     
become of poetry, a god

#### calmer than stone

my special yellow pill     
makes me hungry     
and inclined to sleep     
makes me inclined to weep     

if i were a bird     
i would never fly.     
even with wings     
larger than the sky     
i would be too shy to fly     

no one understands me     
so i will withdraw     
not into a shell, that is but hell     

solid i shall be     
i know nothing yet     

of the true me

i seem weak     
even with my     
metal soul     
even with     
my liquid heart     

my mind is broken     
i have pushed my

else need be spoken

my blood is cool,     
a beautiful type     
of eager drudgery     

my love is an edged,

#### polymath blues

i do too many things     
i wear upon my head     
holy banded rings     

enough crowns     
can cripple the mind     
and turn an able king

of clowns

#### soul-ache

i know not     
how to smile     
without misery     
how to paint a lie     
light and lovely     

right and justly     
have i     
been treated, fairly     
by the forces     
of love. Here i _sigh_

## torch

i burn away     
this night, this day     
all shame - the way     
i once did     
choose to sway     

i ignite within     
the torch of truth     
i shall wear it bold     
upon my soul's     
very cold, tooth

## Mark My Words

If I ever left a permanent mark on my skin because of you       
Then know I loved you       
Know that you hurt me and disappointed      
Know that each mark represents every time you left me       
Know that you're killing me without even knowing it

## in the storm

blazing, truly amazing      
in the cold, yet still bold     
i no longer subscribe     
to all the lies that they told      

> that i might not be that great      
> that i have to stop low     
> ... to suckle on my fate      

they will not soon know     
the wonder that i birth     
and then when they do     
they will plead, but waste breath

close friend of the muse      
i am still inclined to adore     

even when she     
leaves me in my agony for him     
i can trust     
she believes i can be more      

> called me boring      

when i think in every colour      
of the most twisted monochromatic rainbow     

i do not try to repent

for even gods weep      
and some still have much fear

## bread and water

that feeling of being artistic          
that borders on madness,            
far from realistic          

that makes the simple           
to feel they are kingly         
that waters pure folly          
and ruins humanity          

**_it now haunts me_**          
**_shall i fall or stand_**         

that feeling of being artistic          
that helps the weak         
feel strong, and more than heroic           

that makes the broken           
rise and scream prophecy            
that trims off all evil         
from the soul of man            

**_it now haunts me_**

#### Just right

I’m not even sure how all this ties up,       
To make sense but it feels right,       
With knees to the ground and eyes up,       
It just feels right.        

With every mistake made and repeated,       
Lessons not learnt and mind undefeated,       
Repentance, repentance, secreted,       
It all feels just right.        

Encounter upon departure,       
Departure upon merger,        
Tightly-knit circles,       
Now this, this feels quite right.       

Loyalty to betrayal,        
There’s never a round for trials,       
Only those that are tribulations,       
The test run is the actual situation,       
Calculate your risks,       
Even if you don’t,        
At some point,      
You can get used to anything,       
It will all feel just right.

#### How to cook pride

Chop it into pieces,      
Stir it up in a bowl,       
Boil it,        
Sprinkle a spice here, a tear there,            
Marinade it in justification and excuses,       
Preheat your Dutch oven         
that is you ever-so-accurate mind,      
With a side of your largest ego,        
You can butter the pan with the         
lies that you tell yourself,        

Fry it if you want,         
Deep-fry it in the depth        
of all the disappointment,      
As the snaps of their heart         
breaks echo from the fire,      

After you have done all this,       
Or whichever you please,        
You may swallow it.     
And wash it down with a tall glass       
of that ice-cold heart.

#### Power to will

Discipline,         
Is the power of willpower,          
The power to will your mind into        
selectively choosing what is right for you,     
Even when what is right for you         
is not what is easy for you,        
Even when what is right for you         
might not be what is good for you,      
At the time,        
Even when what is right for you      
might just be what brings you pain,     
Even when what is right for         
might not actually be right for you but right for,      
Him, for her, for them.     

The power to will your mind         
into choosing tomorrow over today,      
To look up from your screen         
so you can see the bigger picture.

#### Get to know you        

The most fun I have ever had            
 is getting to know me,         
For me,         
Through me,         
Through God.            

My likes, my dislikes,          
My path …           
Without the pressure and noise          
from the buzzing of notifications,          
Without justifying me           
and actually being true to me.          

Without feeling the need            
to be complemented by anything or anyone,           
Rushed by anything,         
Compared, measured,         
Genuinely living for me,            
It is like an extra Sunday to the week,         
Like the extra five minutes in the morning,         
Like always being on top of your own peak,          
And like the nightingale, I will sing,              
The song of my rejoice that need not be sung,           
For it is its own anthem.

#### artsy heart

life is a tart        
i doubt that i have       
eaten one       

_yet still_       
_imagine it apart_        

all torn up       
in front of you        
showing you secrets       
what do you do        

_yet still_       
_imagine it apart_        

how do you do       
what you should do        
seems like life       
is fucked from the start        

_yet still_       
_imagine it apart_        

life is like an egg       
i eat these often       
they are good for the heart

####  watch me dazzle

i walk the simple way       
of an angel, that does not pray     
i know my path      
i move now with decision      

cut at my folly like a surgeon      
you might not believe this      
you who judge me      

i do so too      
i also think my mind is ugly      
indifference saved me     
_from you and i_      
taught me not to blink, as i fly

what is life, what is love

what's a crow, what's a dove            
tell me if you know         

the way a beat does         	
wrap itself around a soul, if you know          	
tell me if you know         	

all we can ever do,         
is ride low         	
there is no black         
son of god, no dark apostle         	

but i hold it not against any religion	       			
you see, its all supertition            

**_what if god lives in the internet_**         	
**_that is heaven's best bet_**

creatures of the darkness,        
* they feed on the darkness,        

that lurks in our soul        
* pressuring our misery         
  to build their bones        
* destroying our walls,         
  and stealing the stones       

so we're lost in the ruins,         
of our newly corrupted soul.

Maybe one day life        
won't be so complicated,        
Maybe one day we'll shed        
all the insecurities        

that have grown on us and have         
souls that are pure and naked,        
Maybe one day our innocence we'll regain,       
When that time comes we will be children again        

We'll be free to cast our worries aside,        
Forget our problems and throw away        
all the sorrows we have to hide,        
Maybe one day we'll be free to soar         
through life like birds in the sky,       

And maybe one day         
pigs will grow wings        
and learn how to fly

#### prince turned king

I remain hidden in fluctuating        
shades of grey and black        

Horrified by the slaughter of my people       
Horrified by the slaughter of my kind       

I remain hidden for fear of my demise         
And with pain I watch as my father is also        
Slain       

The crown falls from atop his head        
immediately I'm sure he is dead         
Cause the African holds on to the crown till death        

Still in motion the crown         
finds my hiding place and         
stops it's movement at my feet        

I was a prince but now I am king

## pointless

do not fight        
the demons that you see       
the pain within your soul       
your sorrows turned to joy      
the world is just too cold        

do not fight        
the love you know to doubt        
whisper and then shout        
the gods are too asleep       
to help you out         

do not fight        
who you know you are        
you could be a star       
or a blackhole        
either way, you are in the sky        

do not fight        
what helps you remember       
you are made of gold        
who cares if no one cares        
wipe away your tears        

do not fight        
the colours on your soul        
the red that proves you are bloody        
the black that is your mind       
the green that is your flag       

do not fight        
the pointlessness of life       
there is no rhythm to reality       
no one will sing your song        
till you claim it is your anthem

## SILLY THOUGHTS

Sometimes I feel invisible or like      
I exist only in someone's subconscious.       

Like, what if I'm not real        
I mean, what if I'm just a part         
of someone's reality.       
Or what if this is just         
someone's nightmare, Because        
I'm definitely not living a dream.        

I mean, I know for sure         
there could be infinite alternate realities        
to every reality.       

My reality isn't convincing enough.

she is the smoothest singing palm

like bluebirds    

of all the cool faces   
we make up two-thirds   
we are aiming for greatness    
we do what we want to     
there is nothing holding us back

## explain

why can i never    
relay as in ink   
my words, in person - sharper   

the faults i feel i have   
i have told them to you   
you should not remember   

never bother   
the humble and shy   
are not oft recalled

## who i need to be

- - -

#### a man

first and foremost   
thus, i need a companion   

no one can truly breathe alone   

teach me to roam    
across the brightest part   
of Hades' sky    

so i can be the one for you   

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

- - -

#### love galore

i can be loyal     
i need someone   
to be so for   

leave me when you feel    
nothing again   
do not just drift   
like golden dust, again   
let me know - **then**   

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

- - -

#### chocolates

keep you joyful   
but i   
have no sweet tooth   
even if, the first soul   
i ever brushed was a gem   

melt upon me   
sigh atop me   
keep it simple   
blunt and free   

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

- - -

#### deaf man words

you might not like   
my ways, my sayings   
my thoughts and ideas   

but never doubt my   
arithmetic rhythm   
always and forever   

i will prove a deaf man   
spitting on the sun   
cold words

## last page

no more stories       
to tell     

it is unentertaining       
how often   
i have fallen    

**_one last hurrah_**     
**_for the trip in the sky_**    

the bravest ones    
never win    

and surely too    
those farthest from the truth    
never lie

## what i have to say

- - -

#### for now

the pain is a game   
a two minute race   
without face   
without pace   

its a mental mirage   
that burns from within   
it soothes too, i must confess   

herein lies the truth   
of my pathetic sin   

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

- - -

#### barsman

i burn bars   
not for ectasy   

but to reclaim    
the key to reality    
my once sober clarity   
my weak hold on vanity   

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

- - -

#### better already

do i swim or wade through life   
seek out bitter, endless strife   

neither in truth   
i drown each day     

**_in the pool_**   
**_of my mind's tear_**  

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

- - -

## make-believe

thoughts imaginary   
i pull out   
of my magic black hat   
with a rabid white rabbit   

there is no   
saving me   
from make-believe   

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

- - -

## assay

often, and with care   
without reflection   
or a drop of fear   

never ignorant   
getting goals accomplished   
evaluate all   
regardless of where

## a-levels

i dropped out to focus   
and study more   
and mentally soar   

you knock on the door   
for the encore   
i fly, for the high   

i never sleep   
for in the heavens   
you cannot snore

## dar es salaam

## in truth

i am nothing    
just a shell

mo' monkey biz

## other poets

are better than me   
simpler, you see   
free as can be   

with regard to myself,    
i know   

- this is catharsis   
- this has no rhyme   

my depth is shallow at best

## to my future love

#### trust

is a seed   
that does   
not just grow   

first you sow   
then you mend   

**_on and on_**   
**_without end_**   

i will give   
you will take   
just do not   

pretend

with the heat

will never   
in adoring

#### want me

its not complex

_not me indeed_   

but the passion   
you and i   
know i breed   

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

#### reflect

on the way   
you once did walk   
before i passed   
you my cross   

blanched as chalk   
is my soul   
with a center   
full of **melanin**

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

## impatient

i tire   
of waiting   

of skating   
on the fence

of relating   
with pagans   

**_full of pretence_**

i am alone      
that ought not

independent    
broken

fly off rooftops    
all to run away    
from love

the absence

look not

## CONFESSIONS

#### no one can

see this  
so  
i will no try  

i cannot cry,  
will not be  
heard when i die  

care for  
a half-broken soul  

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

- - -

#### understand

i cannot be  
happy in the  
true sense  

there is a  
rhythm to joy  
i might  
never learn  

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

- - -

#### the way

that i feel  
is not so deep  
not so complex  

truly  
not so slick  
disposable  
as a tick  

yet i strive  
for no reason  
for a season  
of spring  

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

- - -

#### my mind beats

illogical  
balanced and grotesque  

like a jungle  
voltaire  
i think _candide_  

instead  
of my heart  
i need it to feel  

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

- - -

#### ... i need a muse

offers were up  
down to the ground  

no one can hear  
my soul's very sound  

i tire of speaking  
painting, and explaining  

the pits of my being  
and broken lofty peaks
